# Submission for PicoDucky
## About the script
I wrote this script mainly for fun but to also show, how can the PicoDucky become a device to help with distractions and the amount of control it can have over your computer.
This script "talks" to the user via notepad for a bit, and then opens up the video of a German soldier watching you for 2 hours straight(just randomly got the idea lol), and it also kills processes the user specifies every 10 seconds.
The script also has basic logic for counting and punishing bypassing attempts, but it is nowhere near good, the script can still be bypassed using a lot of methods(easiest one is just unplugging the picoducky).
